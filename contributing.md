## Contributing to Rejection Challenges
Thanks for your interest on improving Rejection Challenges! ‚ú®

Got a cool idea for a rejection challenge? Submit a pull request! üëç

## Guidelines
The only five things to keep in mind when submitting your pull request are the following:

* The first commit message word is capitalized
* The challenge description first word should be capitalized and without a period
* The challenge description should be a tweet long at max (140 characters or less)
* Add your challenge in one of the 5 categories (Baby Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, Super Hard)
* The challenge should not be offensive/illegal and should not be a life threat to anyone

If all of those requirements are correct, your pull request will be accepted, in case at least one fails, your pull request won't be merged.

Thanks for helping people become better every day! üòÑ
