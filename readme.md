> A list of challenges to overcome fear of rejection âœ‹

## About
Rejection Challenges is a series of challenges to help you overcome fear of rejection.

Imagine not being afraid of failure and rejection, you could accomplish anything in life, you open a whole new world of possibilities, when you accept failure and learn from it nothing can't stop you, that's when you become limitless.

> 'Do one thing every day that scares you.' - Eleanor Roosevelt

## The goal
The goal here is to get comfortable at being rejected, and build confidence on yourself, you'll start to feel the power of becoming fearless right away, I guarantee you that.

## The rules
Take the challenges in any way you want, go for the easy ones and then gradually move to the hard ones, or viceversa, mixed, or [play the game](https://github.com/bntzio/rejection-challenges) ðŸŽ²

The only 3 rules:

1. If a challenge is about achieving/getting something, try your best to get it
2. Do not do the challenges with friends or family
3. Have lots of fun!
